== Introduction

* STUtor is for *tutor coordinators* who prefer to use a *desktop app* for _matching_ and _managing_ a large database of tutors and students.
* This app is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* If you can type fast, STUtor can get your *tutor and student management tasks done faster* than traditional GUI apps.
