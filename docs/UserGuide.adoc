== Introduction

* STUtor is for *tutor coordinators* who prefer to use a *desktop app* for _matching_ and _managing_ a large database of tutors and students.
* This app is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* If you can type fast, STUtor can get your *tutor and student management tasks done faster* than traditional GUI apps.

e.g. typing `*help*` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `*list*` : lists all contacts
* `*add* n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 $/50 sub/Math lvl/Lower Sec stat/Not Matched r/Student` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to STUtor.
* `*delete* 3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* `*exit*` : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
