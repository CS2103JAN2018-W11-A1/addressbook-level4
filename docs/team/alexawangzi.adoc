== PROJECT: STUtor - v1.5

---

== Overview

STUtor -v1.5 is a desktop application targeting tutor coordinators
to help them _match_ and _manage_ a large database of tutors and students. +
The user can perform actions such as adding/ removing a person, editing and view
personal information, match a student with a tutor, and so on. +
The user interacts with the application using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 25 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

=== Major Enhancement

* Added the ability to *match/unmatch a student and a tutor*
** What it does:
allows the user to choose a student and a tutor to match.
Compatibilty checking will be done to ensure validity of the pair(must be one student and one tutor,
must be of the same subject, etc).
Similarly, the user can choose a currently matched pair and unmatch it.
** Justification:
This feature makes the accounting process of matching and unmatching easier,
saving time in marking individual tutor or student and updating their status.
All the user has to provide is the indices of the target student and tutor.

** Highlights:
The new Pair class interact heavily with the existing <<person, Person>> and <<tag, Tag>> class,
and careful thinking is required to ensure good usage of the existing classes
without increasing the coupling.
Please refer to my writings in the *"Contribution to the Developer Guide"* section for detailed explanations on implementation.


=== Minor Enhancement
* Added the ability to accept *case-insensitive input* and *shortcuts* for filling in personal information.
** What it does:
When the user is editing information of a person, the
** Justification:
Since the application is CLI-based and the user has a large database to manage, a lot of typing is required.
Having shortcuts saves time for typing, and acceptance of case-insensitive input means even if the user type
in the wrong case, the input will not be rejected and the user does not need to enter the information all over
again.
** Highlights:
On top of accepting the input as it is, storage format and display are made to follow <<proper-case, proper case>>.
This means information are displayed in a more readable and standardized format, despite it might have been entered
in various cases.
